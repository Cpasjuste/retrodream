#### What is RetroDream ?

[RetroDream](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/retrodream) is a file manager and game loader for the sega dreamcast gaming console. It can browse hard drive (g1-ide, g1-ata) and sdcard for your games, and more capabilities are to come. 
It's an alternative to the popular [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell) application.


#### How does it works ?

For simplicity and interoperability, [RetroDream](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/retrodream) use [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell) loaders, presets and preview images.
You must have [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell) installed either on your hard drive ("/ide/DS") or sdcard ("/sd/DS") so it can find your loaders, presets and preview images.
Next you'll have to copy the [RetroDream](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/retrodream) binary either on your hard drive or sdcard and load it with [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell), or simply replace the [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell) binary ("DS/DS_CORE.BIN") with the [RetroDream](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/retrodream) one.

A [custom bios](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/dreamboot) is in the work to be able to easily select or configure which binary to boot at startup.

A basic configuration file is created in the "RD" direction on either your hard drive or sdcard, with basic settings for now.

A complete and ready to use package, including [DreamShell](https://github.com/DC-SWAT/DreamShell), [RetroDream](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/retrodream), loaders, presets and preview images is located [here](https://dragoncity17.wordpress.com/2020/02/04/sega-dreamcast-retrodream/), thanks to [DragonCity](http://dragoncity17.wordpress.com)
